# MOVIE_REVIEWER
1. Title: Movie Viewer
This project helps people search for movies in a database, comment, and rate them.

2. Description:
Movie Viewer is a movie database website where users can search for movies, and read about them. Registered users can leave comments and ratings on the site, while admins can moderate the user submissions.
The website uses an online movie database API, “Moviedb” to access an online database, and display their content on the website. Because it uses an external database, the API helps connect the program with it, allowing us to free up resources by not creating an own movie database.
In future versions the website could be improved by additional functions too such as chat options or commenting on other comments.

3. Install and Run:
To install the site, users have to put the project’s folder into MAMP or WAMP’s “www” folder. Then as the MAMP/WAMP runs, users have to type “localhost/(folder name)” in the browser. After that the website runs as it intended.

4. Use of the Project:
Not registered users can only use the search bar to look up movies. To register, people have to click on the top right corner registration button. On the upcoming window people need to enter their information and by clicking the registration button they will get access to the site. To log in the same, the top right button has to be used but this time the login functionality. The password bar only shows blanked out characters but with the button next to the password bar they can make it visible.  As people logged in they can search for the movie as before but this time the add comment and add rating options will be visible.
Admins are special users, who have more options to do, especially changing what other people left comments on the site.
